\chapter{Conclusion}

From this project I have gained an immense amount of knowledge with regards to ray tracing.
I must say, I have really enjoyed this course and the project. I would spend many hours every day implementing
the objectives to the best of my ability. I have also discovered how hard it is to truly generate realistic
images.

I hope to continue to work on the ray tracing project into the future and maybe one day I shall be able to 
generate highly realistic images!
